# Requirements

## WordPress

- Advanced plugin development with familiarity with REST API Endpoints, JSON and basic JavaScript as these are not taught.
- Understanding of MySQL.
- Have used or know of ChatGPT.

## OpenAI API Key

For Semantic search, an OpenAI API key is needed. 

OpenAI require $5USF to open an account. The cost during the course is less than $1USD if that and cheaper models can be use.

There is a lot to learn without implememting one's own API key.

## No code along

There is no code along.

All code is preprepared and generated using AI Assisted coding tools.

I use the VS Extension Cline that offers a number of FREE models, although I use paid versions myself when the free models do not perform as required.

[https://claude.ai](https://claude.ai) offers a free but limited quota for a given time period and we will use this to help us in the course.
