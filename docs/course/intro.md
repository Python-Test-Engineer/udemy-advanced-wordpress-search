# Udemy Course

Some people prefer the support or sole stream of a video course.

I have created a Udemy course that covers the fundamental topics expressed in this manual.

For those unfamiliar with the Udemy platform, it tends to have sales once every two weeks and this course would cost around $20USD depending on regional pricing.

## OpenAI API KEY

For Vector Search, and OpenAI API Key is needed. Currently, a minimum initial payment of $5USD is required. The course will use under $1USD for fair usage. Full Text Search does not need an OpenAI API Key.

## Search

Modern websites live or die by the quality of their search experience. If your WordPress site relies on default search, you’re leaving relevance, speed, and user satisfaction on the table. This course gives you the technical depth and practical skills to build powerful, intelligent, production‑ready search systems using MySQL, PHP, embeddings, and Retrieval‑Augmented Generation (RAG).

Designed for developers who want to go beyond plugins and into real search engineering, this course walks you through the full stack of modern search—from classical information retrieval to cutting‑edge AI‑driven ranking.

## What You’ll Learn

- How WordPress search actually works under the hood, and why it struggles at scale
- Implementing MySQL Full‑Text Search (FTS) with boolean mode, natural language mode, and relevance tuning
- Using BM25 for dramatically improved ranking and scoring
- Building semantic search with embeddings and vector databases
- Applying reranking strategies to combine lexical and semantic signals
- Designing RAG pipelines to deliver AI‑powered answers grounded in your site’s content

## Who This Course Is For?

- WordPress developers who want to level up their backend skills
- PHP/MySQL engineers building custom search features
- AI‑curious developers exploring embeddings, LLMs, and RAG
- Anyone responsible for improving search quality, relevance, or user experience

##Why This Course Stands Out

You won’t just watch theory — you will work with prebuilt plugins that enable you to see how the module works and also understand how modern AI Assisted coding is done.

If you’re ready to transform your WordPress search from basic keyword matching into a modern, AI‑enhanced retrieval engine, this course gives you everything you need to make it happen.
