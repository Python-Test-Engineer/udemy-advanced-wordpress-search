# BM25 

## What is BM25?

**BM25** (Best Matching 25th Iteration) an advancement on TF-IDF

**Why is it better than TF-IDF?**

- It has **diminishing returns** - Adding the 10th query term doesn't help as much as adding the 2nd "caquery term".
- It considers **document length** - Longer docs aren't automatically penalized. 
- It has **tuning knobs** - You can adjust it for different use cases with `k1` for key word saturation and `b` for document length.

## The BM25 Formula

## The Formula Breakdown

```
BM25(D, Q) = Σ IDF(qi) × (f(qi, D) × (k1 + 1)) / (f(qi, D) + k1 × (1 - b + b × |D| / avgdl))

Where:

- D = Document being scored
- Q = Query (search terms)
- qi = Each term in the query
- f(qi, D) = Frequency of term qi in document D
- |D| = Length of document D (word count)
- avgdl = Average document length in collection
- k1 = Term frequency saturation parameter (usually 1.2 to 2.0)
- b = Length normalization parameter (usually 0.75)
```

BM25 is a ranking formula that scores how well a document matches a search query.

**The core idea:** For each word in your query, BM25 calculates a score based on:

1. **IDF (Inverse Document Frequency)** - How rare/important the word is across all documents. Rare words get higher scores.

2. **Term frequency with diminishing returns** - How often the word appears in this document, but with a ceiling. The formula `(f × (k1 + 1)) / (f + k1)` means the 1st occurrence matters a lot, the 10th occurrence barely matters.

3. **Length normalization** - Longer documents get penalized (controlled by `b`), because they naturally contain more words. The `(1 - b + b × |D| / avgdl)` part adjusts for document length.

**Example:** Searching "php tutorial"

- "php" appears in 1000 docs → low IDF
- "tutorial" appears in 100 docs → higher IDF  
- A short doc with "tutorial" mentioned 3 times scores higher than a long doc with it mentioned 20 times

The final score is the sum of scores for each query term. Documents with the highest BM25 scores are ranked first.

**Remember:**

- IDF: How special is this word?
- Numerator: Boost the frequency (but not too much)
- Denominator: Normalize for document length and saturation
- Result: A score that balances everything perfectly!

## Understanding the Parameters

### k1 (Term Frequency Saturation)

![idf](../images/fts/k1.png)

**Default: 1.2-2.0**

Controls how quickly we stop caring about additional word occurrences.

```
Word "php" appears:

- 1 time: Very important! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- 2 times: More important! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- 5 times: Somewhat more important ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- 50 times: Not much more important (saturated) ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
```

**Higher k1** = More weight to term frequency  

**Lower k1** = Less weight to term frequency

### b (Length Normalization)

![idf](../images/fts/b.png)

![idf](../images/fts/length-normalisation.png)

**Default: 0.75**

Controls how much document length affects the score.

```
b = 0: Document length doesn't matter at all
b = 0.5: Document length matters somewhat
b = 0.75: Document length matters a good amount (default)
b = 1.0: Document length matters completely
```

**Higher b** = Longer docs penalized more  

**Lower b** = Longer docs penalized less

## Tuning Parameters for Different Use Cases

### *Unfortunately, MySQL does not enable k1 and b tuning for our WordPress sites. If it did then...*

### Higher k1 (e.g., k1 = 2.0):

**Use when:**

- Longer documents are common
- Term frequency is very important
- E-commerce product descriptions
- Technical documentation

**Effect:** More emphasis on how often terms appear

### Lower k1 (e.g., k1 = 1.0):

**Use when:**

- Short documents (tweets, titles)
- Presence matters more than frequency
- News headlines

**Effect:** Less emphasis on repetition

### Higher b (e.g., b = 1.0):

**Use when:**

- Document lengths vary widely
- Shorter docs should be favored
- Blog posts vs. books

**Effect:** Strong length normalization

### Lower b (e.g., b = 0.5):

**Use when:**

- All documents are similar length
- Length shouldn't matter much
- Academic papers (all ~8 pages)

**Effect:** Weak length normalization

## Key Takeaways

**BM25 is smarter than TF-IDF because:**

1. **Diminishing Returns** 

   - The 2nd occurrence helps a lot
   - The 100th occurrence barely helps
   - Prevents keyword stuffing naturally

2. **Length Normalization** 

   - Short, focused docs get a bonus
   - Long, rambling docs get penalized
   - Adjustable with parameter b

3. **Tunable** 

   - k1 controls term frequency importance
   - b controls length normalization
   - Customize for your use case!

4. **More Realistic** 

   - Mimics human relevance judgments
   - Used by Elasticsearch, Lucene, Solr
   - Industry standard for good reason!
