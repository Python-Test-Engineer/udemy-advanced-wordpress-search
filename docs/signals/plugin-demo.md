# Plugin Demo

We can record user actions like queries and results, hovers, clicks to see what a user does and how our search is perfroming.

My recording query_id, session_id along with query, post_ids etc we can then have a crowd-sourced dataset of queries and responses.

The queries can have a vector embedding so when a user asks a question we can semantically search for a similar questions and return the responses from cache as it were, before asking the user if they need a further search.

These can then be use in ML.

We can also add a user feed back of a search result the user clicked to see if it was helpful and comments.
